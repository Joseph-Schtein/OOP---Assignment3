# OOP Assignment 3 The Maze Of Waze Game

In this project we represnt an implementation of the game "The Maze Of Waze". This assignment data structures and algorithms are based on previous project Ex2 and Ex3.

## The main goal of the project is to:

Develop a logic for a game in which a group of robots must perform movement tasks (fruit collection) on a weighted graph.
Create KML files that exemplify the game in google earth.
Collect as many fruits as possible and perform minimum robots moves during limited time of the game.
In this project we added a server that lets other players play, and then you could see your rank among the other players.
you need to enter your ID number to connect to the server.

## How to play:
1. Launch the game with our new feetcherd exeJar!

2. Enter your ID number to connect to the sever (don't worry we wont steel your identity ;-) ).

3. Select mode (a for aouto, and m for manual) **or** enter "b" to see your higest scores or "r" to your rank among yhe other players. 
4. Insert a stage (0-23 options).

4. Insert a stage (0-23 options)

### There are two modes to play to game:
#### Manual:
In manual mode in order to move the robots, click on the screen a message with the robot number appears and insert the destination node for that robot.
Note: only neighbors nodes are valid for robot movement, meaning that the source node and the destination node share an edge, .
#### Automatic:
In Automate mode the robots are moving according an algorithm we developed.
